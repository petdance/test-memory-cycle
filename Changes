        This release has no changes in functionality.

        [FIXES]
        * One of the tests used to use CGI.pm, but it was not a declared
          dependency, so Perl 5.22+ would fail because CGI.pm is no longer
          shipped as core.  The test now uses a local module for testing.
          Thanks, Graham Ollis.
